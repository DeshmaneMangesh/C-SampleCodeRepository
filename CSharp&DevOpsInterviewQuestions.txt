C#

- virtual and override
   In inheritance if we need to extend or re-write the base class function into derived class then we use virtual and override.
   Base class method, which we want to extend in derived class, declared as a virtual. 
   In derived class, we override the method, which we declared virtual in base class.
- inheritance 

- Serialization in C#
  Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. 
  Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization

Design Pattern  : https://dotnettutorials.net/course/dot-net-design-patterns/
1)Creational : responsible for instance/object creation and initialization
 e.g Singleton, Abstract factory, factory method, Builder, Prototype etc.
2)Structural : responsible for instance structure and relationship between object and class
 e.g  Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Flyweight, Proxy
3)Behavioral : responsible for behaviour of objects
 e.g Mediator, Memento, Interpreter, Iterator, Command, Chain of Responsibility, State, Strategy, Observer, Template Method, Visitor. 

Singleton design pattern, how to achieve it
- only one object of class.
define class as sealed class with constructor as private.

ex:
public sealed class Singleton1 {  
    private Singleton1() {}  
    private static Singleton1 instance = null;  
    public static Singleton1 Instance {  
        get {  
            if (instance == null) {  
                instance = new Singleton1();  
            }  
            return instance;  
        }  
    }  
} 


> SOLID principle
 S : Single Responsibility : A Class should have only one purpose/responsibility
 O : Open/Closed : A Class should be open for extension and closed for modification
 L : Liskov Substitution : you should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification
 I : Interface Segregation : clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. Instead of one fat interface, many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one submodule
 D : Dependency Inversion :  high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.

   Extension method help you add more functionality to existing dll/library without modifying original code, inheriting or aggregating it.
   define extension class and method with static keyword
   also pass 1st parameter as this followed by extension method parameter.

Generics :
 tuple if similar methods for different data types e.g int , float or string use generic<T> ( T x, T y)
 delegates : are function pointer created using delegate keyword.
 
 3 types : Func , Action , Predicate
 
 1) Func Delegate :  when we have a function which accepts input and return some output use Func< input, output> NameOfDelegate = input parameter => function body;
 2) Action Delegate : when we have a function which accepts input but has return type as void use Action<input> NameOfDelegate = input parameter => function body;
 3) Predicate Delegate : when we have a function which accepts input but has return type as bool we use Predicate<input> NameOfDelegate = input parameter => function body;

Array Methods

Methods -> https://danielsimionescu.com/csharp/arrays/methods.html

We are going to see the top 10 most important methods provided by the Array class.

#IndexOf
This returns the index of an item inside the array – in our case 2 for lemon 🍋

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };

var result = Array.IndexOf(fruits, "lemon");

Console.WriteLine(result); // 2
#Exists
It checks to see whether or not an item exists in an array (this accepts a Predicate):

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };

var result = Array.Exists(fruits, fruit => fruit.Contains("l"));

Console.WriteLine(result);
#Find
This simply finds an item in an array:

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };

var result = Array.Find(fruits, fruit => fruit.Contains("l"));

Console.WriteLine(result);
#FindLast
As the Find method, but this starts from the end of the array:

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };

var result = Array.FindLast(fruits, fruit => fruit.Contains("l"));

Console.WriteLine(result);
#FindIndex
We can also find the index of an item by using a Predicate:

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };

var result = Array.FindIndex(fruits, fruit => fruit.Contains("l"));

Console.WriteLine(result);
#FindAll
We can find all the items that pass a certain condition:

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };

var result = Array.FindAll(fruits, fruit => fruit.Contains("l"));

foreach (var fruit in result)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fruit);
}
#Reverse
We can reverse the items in an array:

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };

Array.Reverse(fruits);

foreach (var fruit in fruits)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fruit);
}
#Copy
We can copy the items of an array to another one.

The third argument is to specify how many items you want to copy:

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };
var fruits2 = new string[fruits.Length];

Array.Copy(fruits, fruits2, 2);
TIP

To copy all the items, just pass fruits.Length as the third argument.

#Sort
And one of the most important things is to sort an array:

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };

Array.Sort(fruits);

foreach (var fruit in fruits)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fruit);
}
Maybe we want to reverse the order (descending).

In this case, we need to create a new class which implements the IComparer interface:

public class ReverseComparer : IComparer<String>
{
    public int Compare(string x, string y)
    {
        return y.CompareTo(x);
    }
}
And then, just pass an instance of this class as an argument:

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };

Array.Sort(fruits, new ReverseComparer());

foreach (var fruit in fruits)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fruit);
}
#BinarySearch
You can search for an element in a sorted array (make sure to sort the array in ascending order before applying this algorithm):

var fruits = new[] { "melon", "coconut", "lemon" };

Array.Sort(fruits);

var index = Array.BinarySearch(fruits, "coconut");
if (index == -1)
    Console.WriteLine("nothing");
else
    Console.WriteLine(index);
Duplicates

If an array contains duplicate elements (which have the same value), then BinarySearch will return the index of one of those elements.

   - can return only one value
   - Code is compiled each time you called
   - it can only perform select/read operations, can't perform insert/update or delete ops
   - function can have only input parameter
   - function can't call stored procedure in it.
   - function can be called in select statements
   - can be used in filter clause such as where/having/nested queries
   - can use in sql join
   - does not support Transactions
   - does not support exception handling
   
   Requirement : if more read is required go for function
   
  Stored procedure 
   - optional to return value
   - can return 1 or more values
   - code is precompiled at creation time(no compilation required while call)
   - it can perform both select/read operations and insert/update or delete ops
   - procedure can have input and output parameter.
   - procedure can call functions in it.
   - procedure can't be called in select statements
   - cannot use in the filter clause
   - cannot use in SQL joins
   - support Transactions
   - support Exception handling

GIT

Git branching strategy 
1) Git Flow Branch: it supports multiple branches such as master, develop, feature, release and hotfix, it doesn't support CI/CD
2) Github flow : simple one, no multiple branch to maintain , every peace of code to be part of master branch
3) GitLab flow : all changes are done in master and then cherry-picked to form stable 1.0 version of deliverable, it supports CI and versioning.

Conflit resolving

Commands to Resolve Conflicts
1. git log --merge 
The git log --merge command helps to produce the list of commits that are causing the conflict

2. git diff 
The git diff command helps to identify the differences between the states repositories or files

3. git checkout 
The git checkout command is used to undo the changes made to the file, or for changing branches

4. git reset --mixed 
The git reset --mixed command is used to undo changes to the working directory and staging area

5. git merge --abort
The git merge --abort command helps in exiting the merge process and returning back to the state before the merging began

6. git reset
The git reset command is used at the time of merge conflict to reset the conflicted files to their original state
